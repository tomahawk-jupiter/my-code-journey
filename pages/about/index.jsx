        I've been learning how to code with the help of free resources and
        decided to start a blog to log what I have learnt. It's also a chance to
        put some of those things into practise.

        I knew very little about computers when I started (and nothing about
        coding!) but have learnt alot since then. I love coding, its like magic!
        I aim to keep learning and hope to make a career out of it.
