      <p>
        I've been learning how to code with the help of free resources and
        decided to start a blog to log what I have learnt. It's also a chance to
        put some of those things into practise.

        I knew very little about computers when I started (and nothing about
        coding!) but have learnt alot since then. I love coding, its like magic!
        I aim to keep learning and hope to make a career out of it.

        I started with freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project which focus on web
        development. Then various other resources I came across. Apart from web
        dev, I've learnt a bit about computer science, data analyses, bash, web3
        and android.
      </p>
      <p>
        My next step is to work on some real world projects and hopefully land
        my first coding job.
