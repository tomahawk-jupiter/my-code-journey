# My Code Journey - A Blog

A simple blog for documenting useful things I learn.

I used the NextJS tutorial blog site as a starting point and added code syntax highligting and github flavoured markdown for the blog post content.

NOTE: I could not get syntax highlighting working using the Next App Router, so I stuck with the Page Router.

## Start dev server

```sh
yarn dev
# then go to localhost:3000 or whatever url it gives in the console
```
