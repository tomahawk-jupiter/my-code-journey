# Notes

TODOS:

- ✅ Create new project boilerplate.
- ✅ Got the dynamic routes setup - I just copied it from the tutorial example.
- ✅ next font usage (Inter font).
- ✅ changed to using a single layout, applied in `_app.js`.
- Navbar & header/logo - this can go in the `layout` file.
- Footer - can also go in the `layout` file.
  - Copyright, navigation, links (github), contact.
- Basic css layout styling.
- Color & typography css - make it look nice.
- Front-matter
  - what meta data do I want to include, eg. categories, tags.
  - excerpt
- Tweak code examples style, particularly font-size.
- remark-gfm - use this to include some github flavoured markdown features like tables and checklist. Add it to remark in `utils/posts.js` like so: `remark().use(remarkGfm)`.

- PAGE: Home page - short intro & recent posts.
- PAGE: About page - about me & the site. Maybe contact form can go here?
- PAGE: Cheatsheets / quick reference - git commands, bash commands.
- PAGE: Contact form.

EXTRAS

  - Limit posts per page with pagination or load more button.
  - Category/tag dropdown select or button of some kind.
  - Search. Changes displayed posts as user types.
